Recent models have replaced the traditional UNet architecture with the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and employed flow-matching for improved training and sampling. However, they exhibit limited generation diversity. In this work, we leverage this limitation to perform consistent image edits via selective injection of attention features. The main challenge is that, unlike the UNet-based models, DiT lacks a coarse-to-fine synthesis structure, making it unclear in which layers to perform the injection. Therefore, we propose an automatic method to identify ""vital layers"" within DiT, crucial for image formation, and demonstrate how these layers facilitate a range of controlled stable edits, from non-rigid modifications to object addition, using the same mechanism. Next, to enable real-image editing, we introduce an improved image inversion method for flow models. Finally, we evaluate our approach through qualitative and quantitative comparisons, along with a user study, and demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple applications.","Avrahami, Omri; Patashnik, Or; Fried, Ohad; Nemchinov, Egor; Aberman, Kfir; Lischinski, Dani; Cohen-Or, Daniel",Yes,CVPR 2025,Accept (Poster),,,,1
2,Parallel Rescaling: Rebalancing Consistency Guidance for Personalized Diffusion Models,cjwyonsei@yonsei.ac.kr; jiyoonkim@lgcns.com; shwang@seoultech.ac.kr,JungWoo Chae (Nexon Korea); Jiyoon Kim (LGCNS); Sangheum Hwang (Seoul National University of Science and Technology),Text-to-image creation,"Personalizing diffusion models to specific users or concepts remains challenging, particularly when only a few reference images are available. Existing methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion often overfit to limited data, causing misalignment between generated images and text prompts} when attempting to balance identity fidelity with prompt adherence. While Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO) with its consistency-guided sampling partially alleviates this issue, it still struggles with complex or stylized prompts. In this paper, we propose a parallel rescaling technique for personalized diffusion models. Our approach explicitly decomposes the consistency guidance signal into parallel and orthogonal components relative to classifier-free guidance (CFG). By rescaling the parallel component, we minimize disruptive interference with CFG while preserving the subject’s identity. Unlike prior personalization methods, our technique does not require additional training data or expensive annotations. Extensive experiments show improved prompt alignment and visual fidelity compared to baseline methods, even on challenging stylized prompts. These findings highlight the potential of parallel rescaled guidance to yield more stable and accurate personalization for diverse user inputs.","Chae, JungWoo; Kim, Jiyoon; Hwang, Sangheum",No,,Accept (Poster),,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00607,,1

4,Tiled Diffusion,ormadar4@gmail.com; ohadfried@gmail.com,Or Madar (Reichman University); Ohad Fried (Reichman University),Generative models for image & video synthesis,"Image tiling---the seamless connection of disparate images to create a coherent visual field---is crucial for applications such as texture creation, video game asset development, and digital art. Traditionally, tiles have been constructed manually, a method that poses significant limitations in scalability and flexibility. Recent research has attempted to automate this process using generative models. However, current approaches primarily focus on tiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without inherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across diverse domains. This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require tiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images. Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360° synthesis.","Madar, Or; Fried, Ohad",Yes,CVPR 2025,Accept (Poster),,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15185,https://madaror.github.io/tiled-diffusion.github.io/,1

Our method, EOPose, takes a target pose-guidance image as input and uses its keypoint correspondence with the source object image to warp and re-render the latter into the target pose using a novel three-step approach. Unlike generative approaches, our method also preserves the fine-grained details of the object such as its exact colors, textures, and brand marks. We also prepare a new dataset of paired objects based on the Objaverse dataset to train and test our network.

Existing approaches to generate 3D geometry most commonly use meshes as a 3D representation. While meshes are suitable for assets in video games or animations, they lack sufficient precision and adaptability for mechanical engineering purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach for the generation of 3D geometry that generates surface-based Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) by leveraging a code-generation LLM. First, we create a dataset of 3D mechanical parts represented as code scripts by converting Boundary Representation geometry (BREP) into CSG-based Python scripts. Second, we create annotations in natural language using GPT-4. The resulting dataset is used to fine-tune a code-generation LLM. The fine-tuned LLM can complete geometries based on positional input and natural language in a plausible way, demonstrating geometric understanding.","Mews, Maximilian; Aynetdinov, Ansar; Schiller, Vivian; Eisert, Peter; Akbik, Alan",No,,Accept (Poster),,https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15279,,1
8,DreamBlend: Advancing Personalized Fine-tuning of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,shweram@amazon.com,Shwetha Ram (Amazon),Text-to-image creation,"Given a small number of images of a subject, personalized image generation techniques can fine-tune large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to generate images of the subject in novel contexts, conditioned on text prompts. In doing so, a trade-off is made between prompt fidelity, subject fidelity and diversity. As the pre-trained model is fine-tuned, earlier checkpoints synthesize images with low subject fidelity but high prompt fidelity and diversity. In contrast, later checkpoints generate images with low prompt fidelity and diversity but high subject fidelity. This inherent trade-off limits the prompt fidelity, subject fidelity and diversity of generated images. In this work, we propose DreamBlend to combine the prompt fidelity from earlier checkpoints and the subject fidelity from later checkpoints during inference. We perform a cross attention guided image synthesis from a later checkpoint, guided by an image generated by an earlier checkpoint, for the same prompt. This enables generation of images with better subject fidelity, prompt fidelity and diversity on challenging prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods.","Ram, Shwetha",Yes,WACV 2025,Accept (Poster),,https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19390,,1
9,Harnessing the Power of Training-Free Techniques in Text-to-2D Generation for Text-to-3D Generation via Score Distillation Sampling,triplepoint@postech.ac.kr; wookiekim@postech.ac.kr; mscho@postech.ac.kr,"Junhong Lee (POSTECH); Seungwook Kim (POSTECH, bytedance); Minsu Cho (POSTECH)",Generative models for 3D,"Recent studies show that simple training-free techniques can dramatically improve the quality of text-to-2D generation outputs, e.g., Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) or FreeU. However, these training-free techniques have been underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.","Lee, Junhong; Kim, Seungwook; Cho, Minsu",No,,Accept (Poster),,,,1

We propose \name as a method for editing 3D object compositions in videos of static scenes with camera motion. Our approach allows editing the 3D position of a 3D object across all frames of a video in a temporally consistent manner. This is achieved by lifting intermediate features of a generative model to a 3D reconstruction that is shared between all frames, editing the reconstruction, and projecting the features on the edited reconstruction back to each frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative approach to edit object compositions in videos.

Synthesizing sustained footage (e.g. over minutes) still remains an open research question. In this paper, we propose MALT Diffusion (using Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers), a new diffusion model specialized for long video generation. MALT Diffusion (or just MALT) handles long videos by subdividing them into short segments and doing segment-level autoregressive generation. To achieve this, we first propose recurrent attention layers that encode multiple segments into a compact memory latent vector; by maintaining this memory vector over time, MALT is able to condition on it and continuously generate new footage based on a long temporal context. We also present several training techniques that enable the model to generate frames over a long horizon with consistent quality and minimal degradation. We validate the effectiveness of MALT through experiments on long video benchmarks. For example, MALT achieves an FVD score of 220.4 on 128-frame video generation on UCF-101, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of 648.4. Finally, we explore MALT's capabilities in a text-to-video generation setting and show that it can produce long videos compared with recent techniques for long text-to-video generation.","Yu, Sihyun; Hahn, Meera; Kondratyuk, Dan; Shin, Jinwoo; Gupta, Agrim; Lezama, José; Essa, Irfan; Ross, David; Huang, Jonathan",No,,Accept (Oral),,https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.12632,,1

Because high noise levels are associated with recovering large-scale image structures and low noise levels with recovering details, this configuration can result in low-quality and blurry images. However, it should be possible to improve details while spending fewer steps recovering structures because the semantic latent code should already contain structural information. Based on the above insight, we propose a new DAE training method that improves the quality of reconstructed images. We divide training into two phases. In the first phase, the DAE is trained as a vanilla autoencoder by always setting the noise level to the highest, forcing the encoder and decoder to populate the semantic latent code with structural information. In the second phase, we incorporate a noise schedule that spends more time in the low-noise region, allowing the DAE to learn how to perfect the details. Our method results in images that have accurate high-level structures and low-level details while still preserving useful properties of the semantic latent codes.","Khungurn, Pramook; Thawatdamrongkit, Phonphrm; Seripanitkarn, Sukit; Suwajanakorn, Supasorn",No,,Accept (Poster),,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21368,,1

They cooperate to create Blender scripts which render a video that best aligns with the given description. Based on film making inspiration and augmented with Blender-based movie making knowledge, the Director agent decomposes the input text-based video description into sub-processes. For each sub-process, the Programmer agent produces Python-based Blender scripts based on customized function composing and API calling. Then, the Reviewer agent, augmented with knowledge of video reviewing, character motion coordinates, and intermediate screenshots uses its compositional reasoning ability to provide feedback to the Programmer agent. The Programmer agent iteratively improves the scripts to yield the best overall video outcome.

Unfortunately, relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of auxiliary features, which degrades the quality of the generation. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both concept representation and editing, leading to an overall superior result compared to existing techniques.","Kim, Minseo; KWON, MINCHAN; Lee, dongyeun; Jeon, Yunho; Kim, junmo",No,,Accept (Poster),,,,2

However, the proposed merging strategies overlook that the optimal way to combine the generation processes might depend on the particularities of each pre-trained generative model and also the specific textual descriptions. In this context, we introduce MixerMDM, the first learnable model composition technique for combining pre-trained text-conditioned human motion diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches, MixerMDM provides a dynamic mixing strategy that is trained in an adversarial fashion to learn to combine the denoising process of each model depending on the set of conditions driving the generation. By using MixerMDM to combine single- and multi-person motion diffusion models, we achieve fine-grained control on the dynamics of every person individually, and also on the overall interaction. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation technique that, for the first time in this task, measures the interaction and individual quality by computing the alignment between the mixed generated motions and their conditions as well as the capabilities of MixerMDM to adapt the mixing throughout the denoising process depending on the motions to mix.","Ruiz Ponce, Pablo",Yes,CVPR 2025,Accept (Poster),,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01019,,2

However, if one asks the generator to synthesize a specific camera setting such as creating different fields of view using a 24mm lens versus a 70mm lens, the generator will not be able to interpret and generate scene-consistent images. This limitation not only hinders the adoption of generative tools in professional photography but also highlights the broader challenge of aligning data-driven models with real-world physical settings. In this paper, we introduce Generative Photography, a framework that allows controlling camera intrinsic settings during content generation. The core innovation of this work are the concepts of Dimensionality Lifting and Differential Camera Intrinsics Learning, enabling smooth and consistent transitions across different camera settings. Experimental results show that our method produces significantly more scene-consistent photorealistic images than state-of-the-art models such as Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.","Yuan, YU; Wang, Xijun; Sheng, Yichen; Chennuri, Prateek; Zhang, Xingguang; Chan, Stanley",Yes,CVPR 2025,Accept (Poster),,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02168,https://generative-photography.github.io/project/,2
